Both were classified as a respiratory event that required a 50% reduction in Nasal Flow signal for at least 10 seconds.<br><br>Estimated sleep duration, providing an approximation of total sleep duration (i.e. total sleep time) inferred from analysis of non-EEG channels [Zhao et al., 2017 (PMID:27707441)]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5181603/)  Any continuous periods of >=20 min with loss of respiratory channel was marked as wake and not included in the estimates.
