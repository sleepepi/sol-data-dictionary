Sleep duration is the interval between sleep onset time and sleep offset time while asleep, while sleep period is the interval between sleep onset time and sleep offset time. <br><br>This variable is similar to variable sawa34; however, sawa34 is derived from Actiware variable sawa24 before data optimization.
